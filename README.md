Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis for Enhanced Engagement

Objective:
The goal of this analysis is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis. By understanding customer engagement patterns, the e-commerce platform can optimize marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and drive revenue growth.

One effective approach to achieving this is RFM analysis, which evaluates customers based on three key factors:

Recency (R): How recently a customer made a purchase

Frequency (F): How often they make purchases

Monetary Value (M): The total amount spent by the customer

An e-commerce platform has provided a dataset containing transaction details such as customer ID, purchase date, transaction amount, product details , order ID, and customer location. The goal is to leverage RFM analysis to categorize customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior.

Key Areas of Analysis:
Recency Analysis: Identifying how recently a customer has made a purchase to assess their engagement level.

Frequency Analysis: Determining how often a customer makes purchases to classify them as loyal, occasional, or inactive buyers.

Monetary Value Analysis: Evaluating the total spending of each customer to distinguish high-value customers from lower-spending ones.

Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers into categories such as loyal customers, at-risk customers, new customers, and dormant customers based on their RFM scores.

Insights for Marketing Strategy: Using RFM scores to create personalized marketing campaigns, re-engagement strategies, and loyalty programs to enhance customer lifetime value
